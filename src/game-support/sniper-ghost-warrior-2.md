{{#template ../templates/rating.md status=Silver installs=Yes opens=Yes}}

## Setup

- Go into `Options` -> `Video` -> `Basic` and set the `DirectX` option to `DirectX9`. This will make the game playable on any graphical setting. Using `DirectX11` causes any `Graphics Quality` option set above "Low" inplayable due to the immense FPS and in-game time slowdown.

> [!NOTE]
> CryEngine warning about unsupported video card appears on each game launch. Click `OK` and ignore it as it does not affect anything.

> [!WARNING]
> Sound is stuttering during slow-motion scenes sometimes.
