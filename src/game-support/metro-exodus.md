# Metro Exodus
<!-- script:Aliases [] -->

{{#template ../templates/rating.md status=Bronze installs=Yes opens=Yes}}

> [!NOTE]
> Enhanced Edition won't open due to the lack of DXR 1.1 (DirectX 12's Raytracing) support. The standard one runs well.

> [!WARNING]
> There is an issue with setting higher resolution, including native when it is already lowered. Then a screen resolution can be restored to native only in the config file as the game does not show anything above the actually lowered screen resolution. It can be done via `user.cfg` which is located in the game installation directory, not in the Windows' `Documents` like mentioned elsewhere. Also colorful normal maps appear sometimes on metal and wooden surfaces and within some particles types. Changing audio output in macOS turns the game's audio off. It is required to restart the game then.
