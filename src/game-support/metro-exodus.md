# Metro Exodus
<!-- script:Aliases [] -->

{{#template ../templates/rating.md status=Silver installs=Yes opens=Yes}}

> [!NOTE]
> Enhanced Edition won't open due to the lack of DXR 1.1 (DirectX 12's Raytracing) support. The standard one runs well.

> [!WARNING]
> There is an issue with setting higher resolution, including native when it is already lowered. Then a screen resolution can be restored to native only in the config file as the game does not show anything above the actually lowered screen resolution. It can be done via `user.cfg` which is located in the game installation directory, not in the Windows' `Documents` like mentioned elsewhere.
