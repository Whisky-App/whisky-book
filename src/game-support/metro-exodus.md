> [!NOTE]
> Enhanced Edition won't open due to the lack of DXR 1.1 (DirectX 12's Raytracing) support. The standard one runs well.
> When tesselation is set to "High" or "The Highest" option, it causes random textures to appear above the ground. FPS may drop significantly when entering areas full of smoke and light. Also setting gamma doesn't work.
