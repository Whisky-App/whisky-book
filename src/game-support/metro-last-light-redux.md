> [!WARNING]
> - When tesselation is set to "High" or "The Highest" option, it causes random textures to appear above the ground.
> - FPS may drop significantly when entering areas full of smoke and light.
> - Gamma setting doesn't work.
> - There is an issue with setting higher resolution, including native when it is already lowered. Then a screen resolution can be restored to native only in the config file as the game does not show anything above the actually lowered screen resolution.
