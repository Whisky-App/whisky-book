> [!NOTE]
> When tesselation is set to "High" or "The Highest" option, it causes random textures to appear above the ground. FPS may drop significantly when entering areas full of smoke and light. Also setting gamma doesn't work.

> [!WARNING]
> There is an issue with setting higher resolution, including native when it is already lowered. Then a screen resolution can be restored to native only in the config file as the game does not show anything above the actually lowered screen resolution.
