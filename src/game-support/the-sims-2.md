> [!WARNING]
> The Sims 2 is reliant on DirectX 9, which is largely unsupported by Whisky at this stage.

> [!NOTE]
> This game is not available to purchase and the Windows version is considered abandonware. This guide uses the open source installer [The Sims 2 Starter Pack](https://github.com/voicemxil/TS2-Starter-Pack)

## Setup

- Install using [The Sims 2 Starter Pack](https://github.com/voicemxil/TS2-Starter-Pack), using their [guide](https://voicemxil.github.io/TS2-Starter-Pack/) (web or standalone installer).
- Run the launcher of your choosing. This will result in a graphics-related error.
