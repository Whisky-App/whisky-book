> [!WARNING]
> The game lacks some online multiplayer features when using Whisky. The proximity chat doesn't work at all in lobby, and in-game you can only hear the other people in the lobby and not talk to them. It is most likely a product of the microphone not getting permissions in macOS settings, but you can't change it because Phasmaphobia/Whisky/Steam never asks for permissions.
