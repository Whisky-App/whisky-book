# Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2
<!-- script:Aliases [] -->

{{#template ../templates/rating.md status=Gold installs=Yes opens=Yes}}

## Setup

- Go into `Options` -> `Video` -> `Basic` and set the `DirectX` option to `DirectX9`. This will make the game playable on any graphical setting. Using `DirectX11` causes any `Graphics Quality` option set above "Low" inplayable due to the immense FPS and in-game time slowdown.
