# Persona 4 Golden

{{#template ../templates/rating.md status=Garbage date=03/31/24 installs=Yes opens=No}}

Persona 4 Golden is currently **unplayable** in Whisky.

<!--
## Setup

- Install as normal
- Open `winetricks`
- Go to `DLLs` tab
- Run `wmp10`

Either wmp10 does not currently work with Whisky or there is something in Wineskin that makes p4g work. either way, runs on wineskin, but not whisky
Also, there appears to be a bug where the game will crash when entering the first dungeon, if you get it to run.
I haven't had the time to test this yet but i will soon
