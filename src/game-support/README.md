# Game Support

This is by no means an exhaustive list of games that run in Whisky.
Neither is it an exhaustive list of fixes for games that need them.
If a game you want to play isn't working and is missing from this list,
be sure to contribute to these docs on GitHub.

### Categories Explained

Game support status is rated on a scale. The placement of a particular
title is partially left to the article author, but some general guidelines apply.

| Status  | Description                                                                                    |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gold    | Game works out-of-the-box with no issues and/or requires minimal workarounds.                  |
| Silver  | Game requires some workarounds, but they are simple and/or there are minor in-game issues      |
| Bronze  | Game is very difficult to get working and/or has severe in-game issues that limit playability. |
| Garbage | Game does not work at all.                                                                     |
