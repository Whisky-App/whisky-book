# Game Support

This is by no means an exhaustive list of games that run in Whisky.
Neither is it an exhaustive list of fixes for games that need them.
If a game you want to play isn't working and is missing from this list,
be sure to contribute to these docs on GitHub.

### Categories Explained

Game support status is rated on a scale. The placement of a particular
title is partially left to the article author, but some general guidelines apply.
