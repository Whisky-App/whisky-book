Requires Wine configuration change to "Automatically caputure the mouse in full-screen windows" to be checked, then the mouse works properly in gameplay and menus.

When using a controller, both analog sticks look and move at the same time. I was not able to find any servers or join any games. Solo missions work perfectly. The game runs well in DX12 mode.
