## Setup

- Install in Steam as normal.
- Run DLL winetricks: `vcredist2022`, `dsound`, `wmp9`, `wmp10` and `wmp11`.
- Run with argument `-window:X` to play on a different monitor, with `X` being the monitor number.
- When opening the game, switch to another window and then back to The Sims. The game will then run without issue.
