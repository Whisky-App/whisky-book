When using DirectX11 or Vulkan renderer it produces around 40 FPS on any settings (M1 Max, 3440x1440)
The game sometimes stutters in normal locations and has significant FPS problems in boss fights.

## Setup

- Install in Steam as normal
- Open `drive_c/users/crossover/Documents/My Games/Path of Exile 2/poe2_production_Config.ini` and change renderer_type to DirectX11
