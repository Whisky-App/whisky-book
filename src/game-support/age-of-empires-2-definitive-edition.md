> [!NOTE]
> Other than the start menu, Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition runs fine through Whisky when in a game, and if the player is familiar with the controls beforehand.  

> [!WARNING]
> The start-up menu UI does not display text on any buttons. Unless you know already how to navigate the menu, this can be very frustrating.
