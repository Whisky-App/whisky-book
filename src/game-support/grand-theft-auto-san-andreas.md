> [!WARNING]
> - The Rockstar Games Launcher will fail with the `The Rockstar Games Launcher failed to initialize!` error when `DXVK` is turned `off` in your `Bottle Configuration`. `DXVK` can turned `on` to workaround the launcher error.
> - The game crashes immediately during load without error message and is therefore currently unplayable in Whisky.

## Setup

- Install in Rockstar Games as normal.
- In Whisky open "Bottle Configuration" and:
  - If not on, turn `DXVK` on.
- Download and install the game from the Rockstar Games Launcher as usual.
