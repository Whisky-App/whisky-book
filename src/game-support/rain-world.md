Runs out of the box. Gamepad and keyboard are supported. All campaigns including those in the Downpour DLC are completely playable with very few issues.

> [!WARNING]
> - Performance may degrade in rooms depending on the creature type and count quicker than expected due to the 32-bit nature of the game.
> - [An unofficial community-made patch]( https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3309890385) replacing the Unity engine player with a 64-bit version mostly fixes this issue.
> - With some mods, opening the Remix menu may freeze the game indefinitely, or mods may not correctly apply. Entering the Story, Expedition, Arena or Regions modes and then exiting will allow the menu to open properly in most cases.
> - Some mods may require opening `Bottle Configuration` > `Open Wine Configuration` > `Libraries` and adding an override for `winhttp` set to `(native, builtin)`.
