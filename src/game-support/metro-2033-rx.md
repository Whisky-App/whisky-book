> [!NOTE]
> Enabling tesselation causes objects that use this option like stones flickering. FPS may drop significantly when entering areas full of smoke and light. Also setting gamma doesn't work.

> [!WARNING]
> There is an issue with setting higher resolution, including native when it is already lowered. Then a screen resolution can be restored to native only in the config file as the game does not show anything above the actually lowered screen resolution.
