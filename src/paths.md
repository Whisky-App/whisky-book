# What's Where?

Whisky installs files to the following locations:

| Item      | Location                                                           |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GPTK      | `~/Library/Application Support/com.isaacmarovitz.Whisky/Libraries` |
| Bottles   | `~/Library/Containers/com.isaacmarovitz.Whisky/Bottles`            |
| Logs      | `~/Library/Logs/com.isaacmarovitz.Whisky`                          |
| WhiskyCmd | `/usr/local/bin/whisky`                                            |

Note that you may need to press `âŒ˜ + Shift + .` to view hidden files, and that `com.isaacmarovitz.Whisky` may show up as a folder simply titled `Whisky`.
