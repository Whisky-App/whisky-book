### Adding Game Pages:
0. Standards to uphold:
   - Ensure proper grammar, capitalization, spelling, spacing, and general professionalism. Jokes and such are allowed, but lets prioritize helping others before all else.
   - Ensure accuracy. Don't upload misleading information, false reports, guesses, or improper research.
   - Cite your sources. Found a guide from somewhere else? Found a solution or other thing online? Provide a link in your page. This isn't a requirement that's going to get your PR rejected, but simply one that future-proofs things and ensures that if a game suddenly breaks, we can check our sources and see if there are any updates to the solutions found.
   - Document the installation process and any errors that arise during the installation. If installation fails, set `installs=No` in the `Ratings` template.
   - Document whether a program opens by setting `opens=Yes` in the `Ratings` template. A program is considered "open" if it launches the title screen or main menu. Dialog messages don't count as a program "opening". Write down all issues that you have noticed while playing a title under a `> [!WARNING]` heading.
   - Add status ratings to your game based on the following scale. We leave this up to general author interpretation, but please make sure you're still following these general guidelines:

    | Status   | Description                                                                                    |
    |----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Platinum | Game without any defects and runs perfectly.                                                   |
    | Gold     | Game can be configured to run perfectly and without any defects.                               |
    | Silver   | Game requires some configuration to run and or has minor defects.                              |
    | Bronze   | Game is very difficult to get working and or has severe in-game issues that limit playability. |
    | Garbage  | Game is unplayable.                                                                            |
  
1. Create a new markdown file in `~/whisky-book/src/game-support` with the name of the game.
   - Format your file in all lowercase, using only alphabetical, numerical, and dash characters. Do not use abbreviations as they mess up titles ordering with an exception of `goty` which stands for "Game of the Year" and is used among many titles and known as a standard. Use a dash sign (`-`) everytime a space occurs in the original title. Replace roman numerals with arabic ones to distinguish words from numbers. Do not insert any [articles](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/parts-of-speech/articles/) in a markdown file name (`a`, `the`). Remember to match a filename with a full game title (eg. from Steam) using above exceptions and restrictions. If a game is not listed on Steam then add the store/page name at the very end of the file like `<some-game>-gog` i.e:
   ```
   Diablo IV (Battle.net) -> diablo-4-battle-net
   Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions Evolved -> geomatry-wars-3-de.md
   Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain -> metal-gear-solid-5-phantom-pain.md
   Persona 3 Reload -> persona-3-reload.md
   Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order -> star-wars-jedi-fo.md
   Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus -> wolfenstein-2-new-colossus.md
   ```
2. Add the following template to your markdown file. Ensure that the game name you enter at the beginning of the file matches Steam or other store listing name fully, including capitalization. However remove any character that is not an ASCII printable character. You can find the allowed characters list [here](https://www.ascii-code.com/characters/printable-characters).
   ```
   # <Full Game Name Here>

   {{#template ../templates/rating.md status=<status> installs=<Yes/No> opens=<Yes/No>}}
   ```
   If your game is a Steam game, add this text at the **bottom** of the page. You can find the Steam ID of a game by going to it's Steam page. It will be the number in the URL bar between `/app/` and `/<game name>/`.
   ```
   {{#template ../templates/steam.md id=<steam_id>}}
   ```
   Ensure that you're replacing the `<>` tags with the proper values in order to comply with the wiki layout. Below is an example of what [Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order](https://docs.getwhisky.app/game-support/sw-fallen-order.html) will look like, and what it will look like on the wiki.
   ```
   # Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order

   {{#template ../templates/rating.md status=Gold installs=Yes opens=Yes}}
   
   ## Setup
   
   - Install in Steam as normal.
   - In Whisky, find `SwGame-Win64-Shipping.exe` in the Program list and run it.
   
   {{#template ../templates/steam.md id=1172380}}
   
   ```

3. Run the `generate` script with `./scripts/generate.mjs` to update `SUMMARY.md`.
   This will also make the game appear in the sidebar of the book.
4. Run `./scripts/lint.mjs` to ensure that your changes are properly formatted.

You **MUST** run **BOTH** the `generate` and `lint` commands before creating a PR. Your PR will not (and can not) be merged until you do this.

5. Create a pull request detailing the changes you made. Ensure that it's consise, yet readable and coherent.
   - You will need to create a fork of `whisky-book` and push your changes there before creating a PR. Once you've done that, then you can submit a PR to merge your fork with `main`.
6. Sit back, wait for PR reviews, and make changes as necessary.
